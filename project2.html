    <h1>Health Nutrition App</h1>
    <p>
      Using Visual Studio Code, I designed and implemented a working nutrition app that functions
      similarly to MyFitnessPal. The project was built using Laravel as the backend framework and 
      integrates the Nutritionix API via an API key and Postman to retrieve real food data.

      <p class="caption">
        The dashboard displays the total calories consumed for the day based on foods the user has added.
        This helps users monitor their daily calorie intake at a glance.
      </p>

    <div class="screenShotH2">
      <img src="images/project2.4.png" alt="Food Search Feature">
      <p class="caption">
        Users can search for foods using the Nutritionix API. Once an item is selected, they can view its 
        nutritional details or add it to their daily meal log.
      </p>

    <div class="screenShotH1">
      <img src="images/project2.5.png" alt="Nutritional Information">
      <p class="caption">
        The nutritional information screen displays detailed food data, including calories, protein, carbs,
        and fat content ‚Äî all retrieved dynamically from the Nutritionix API.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="screenShotH2">
      <img src="images/project2.6.png" alt="Meal Logging Example">
      <p class="caption">
        The meal logging system lets users track what they‚Äôve eaten. Foods are stored in the session 
        rather than a database, allowing totals to update instantly.
      </p>

  <div class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The app is powered by Laravel. When a user searches for a food item, a request is sent to a Laravel
      controller that communicates with the Nutritionix API. The API response ‚Äî containing calories,
      protein, carbs, and fats ‚Äî is displayed instantly on the interface. User-selected foods are stored 
      within the session, and the total calories are dynamically calculated and shown on the dashboard.
